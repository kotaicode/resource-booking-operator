00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
With the resource booking operator we can manage cloud resources using Kubernetes custom operator.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
First, we apply our monitor resource.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This custom resource scans for instances of the given type and adds them to the cluster, grouped by their resource name.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Once we have our resources represented on the cluster, we can manage their state with bookings.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We apply a booking resource to the cluster, which runs the analytics resource.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
On the bottom left we see a table of EC2 instances, their status, and their assigned resource names.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We can see the analytics instances waking up both in the table from the aws cli, and also from our list of resources available in the cluster.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Triggered by the booking we just added to the cluster, which will keep the instances running until it expires.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This can also be expanded to other types of cloud resources.
